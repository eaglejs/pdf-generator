# pdf-generator
Created in 2011, this shell script will take images (tiff, jpg, png), word docs, excel docs, 
and other pdfs and combine them into one master pdf document.
I added this recently so it is definitely a work in progress and may not necessarily work out of the box.
ToDo: I need to possibly release this inside of Docker so that it will have all of the dependencies needed to run.
Right now it is missing all of the dependencies so it heavily relies on you to configure your linux box to run. I realize that this is poorly documented.
It was written in my very early years of programming, so just know that this is definitely a work in progress and I'll start being more active 
in it's development so it may change drastically.
